# Building Modern Web Apps with React Router

React Router is a powerful library that enables client-side routing in React applications. With the release of version 7, it's more powerful than ever.

## Key Features

- File-based routing
- Data loading with loaders
- Data mutations with actions
- Error handling
- And much more!

React Router provides a simple way to navigate between different views of your application. It allows you to handle URL changes and render different components based on the URL.

## Getting Started

```jsx
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <Home />,
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />,
  },
]);

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}
```

This is just the beginning of what's possible with React Router. Stay tuned for more in-depth tutorials!
