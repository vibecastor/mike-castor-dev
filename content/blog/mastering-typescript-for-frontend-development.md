# Mastering TypeScript for Frontend Development

TypeScript has become an essential tool for modern frontend development. Its static typing system helps catch errors early and provides better tooling for developers.

## Why TypeScript?

- Static typing
- Better IDE support
- Improved code quality
- Easier refactoring

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. This makes it easy to gradually adopt TypeScript in existing projects.

## Basic Types

```typescript
// Basic types
let isDone: boolean = false;
let decimal: number = 6;
let color: string = "blue";
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let x: [string, number] = ["hello", 10]; // Tuple

// Interfaces
interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Hayes",
  id: 0,
};
```
